Company Side (Super Admin, Admin, Normal User) – Manages products, orders, and customers.
Customer Side (Customers) – Browses products, places orders, makes payments.
🔹 Updated User Roles (Including Customer)
Role	Can Do
Super Admin	Manage everything: Users (Admins, Normal Users, Customers), Products, Orders, Payments, Categories
Admin	Manage Products, Orders, Customers, and Complete Orders
Normal User (Company Staff)	Edit Items, Complete Orders

🔹 How the System Works – Step by Step Workflow

1️⃣ Customer Side (Website User)
Signup/Login

New customers register or log in.
The system saves them in the User collection with role = "customer".
Browsing Products

The customer can see products categorized as "Coffee Beans," "Cappuccino," etc.
Product details like price, description, and availability are displayed.
Adding to Cart

Customers add items to their cart (which is stored in the frontend or session).
Checkout & Payment

Customers choose a payment method:
Credit Card
Debit Card
PayPal
Cash on Delivery
Order details are saved in the Order collection.
Payment details are recorded in the Payment collection.
Order Confirmation & Email Notification

After payment, the system sends a confirmation email with delivery details.


2️⃣ Company Side (Super Admin / Admin / Normal User)
Admin Receives Order

The order appears in the Admin Panel.
The admin or super admin changes the order status (pending → processing → shipped → delivered).
Normal User / Admin Completes Order

Once delivered, a company staff member (Normal User, Admin, or Super Admin) marks the order as "Completed."
Super Admin & Admin Manage Products and Users
